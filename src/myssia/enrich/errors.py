"""Structured enrich-layer errors (error-handling spec: 字段路径+错误类+原因).

Subclasses :class:`ValueError` so the CLI's config-error path (exit code 1)
catches it: an unusable enrich configuration (missing/plaintext endpoint
reference, unresolved env var, malformed prompt data file) is a *startup*
failure in the same family as a refused YAML — fail fast, never half-run
with a broken second funnel. One deliberate exception to the startup
timing: a missing optional dependency (``dependency_missing``, the
``openai`` package) surfaces at the **first LLM call**, not at construction
— the client imports it lazily, and enrich/aggregate isolate that failure
per batch like any other (降级不中断).

Runtime problems (LLM 超时/响应不可解析/单批失败) deliberately do NOT use this
class: they are isolated per batch inside :meth:`LLMEnricher.enrich` and
surface as structured failure records on :class:`EnrichOutcome` — the run
degrades to keyword-only filtering instead of dying.
