"""Structured storage-layer errors (PRD 10-01-v02-storage-hardening).

The store must never fail with a bare string: a corrupt database file or a
schema version the binary does not understand is a *startup* failure and has
to be machine-consumable (``myssia doctor`` v0.2, repairing agents) — field
paths / codes / found-vs-expected values, Chinese human message.

Subclasses :class:`ValueError` so construction-time callers (``Pipeline(...)``)
and the CLI config-error family treat it uniformly — and ``myssia run`` has an
explicit ``except StoreSchemaError`` handler around the run itself, because the
store opens lazily inside ``pipeline.run()`` (exit code 1, structured
``{"error": "store", ...}`` on stdout under ``--json``).
